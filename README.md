#Python API Challenge


 Part 1: WeatherPy

Created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities of varying distance from the equator 
The first created a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

After each plot, added a sentence or two explaining what the code is analyzing.
Computed the linear regression for each relationship. Separated the plots into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):

* Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
Explained the linear regression is modeling to describe any relationships.

Part 2: VacationPy
Used Jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API.
* Create a heat map that displays the humidity for every city 
* A max temperature lower than 80 degrees but higher than 70.
* Wind speed less than 10 mph.
* Zero cloudiness.
* Used Google Places API to find the first hotel for each city located within 5,000 meters of your coordinates.

* Ploted the hotels on top of the humidity heatmap, with each pin containing the Hotel Name, City, and Country data.
